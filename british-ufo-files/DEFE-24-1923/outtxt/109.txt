15.7.85, #.06 pm — 4.10 pm.

Spherical, approx 30—h0 feet diameter, with appearance of highly
golished silver metal, with a protruding lip § of the way from

the battom, this being mid grey in colour. The lower surface of
this lip seemed to have a flat surface on the horizontal axis of the
sphere, the upper surface of the 119 seemed concave and faired in.
The object emitted a throbbing double—beat sound somewhat akin t9 a
ship's propeller. The object became silent before it was out of the
audio range one would expect, as if the sound source had stopped.
