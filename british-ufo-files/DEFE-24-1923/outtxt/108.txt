Dear Sir,
Report of Unidentified Flying Object

, Please find enclosed UFO report from _

This report was initially relayed to ATS Dunsfold by
fiancee who is a %employee at Dunsfold. It was net
passed by telephone 0 M1 1tary as I considered the time delay'fram
observation to receipt of the report at Dunsfold would not constitute an
‘immediate‘ report.

The: Dunafold radar controller on duty at the time of the reported
observation does not recall seeing anything unusual on radar in the
vicinity of Horsham at the appropriate time.

Yours fa‘ fully,

       

Manager ATS Services 5 ‘
